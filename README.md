# beautifulblog
This is the configuration of a Blog created through WordPress using the Twenty Seventeen theme. The WP Super Cache plugin was also installed. This project was created entirely in order to study the WordPress platform and learn from it.

# Testing
If you want to have these configurations on your localhost and play with it, please follow the following steps:
1 - Locate the "database" directory and execute the beaultifulblog.sql file on your MySql (I use XAMPP as environment).
2 - Put the "beaultifulblog" directory into your "theme" WordPress directory. 
3 - Activate it.
